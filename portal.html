									<h2><a href="#">Portal Defender</h2>
									<p>This was a solo project, built from scratch using assets I found online. The core mechanics were created using Euler calculations. I had also created animations being triggered by registering collisions. Randomly spawned enemies and powerups in different locations of the map. UI system displaying player information was also created. </p>

								<h3>Details</h3>
											<ul>
												<li>Implemented the core mechanics of the game using Euler calculations. Core gameplay loop was designed and implemented from scratch. 
												<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
												  <li style="margin-left:2em">Implementing the core mechanism was the biggest hurdle while creating the game. I had to figure out a way to allow the player to rotate around the blackhole upto a certain radius.</li>
												  <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">I acomplished this by tying the vertical input to the radius and the horizontal input to the angle of rotation. I gave both the radius and angle a max ceiling value and calculated the euler angle with the position vector and angle of rotation. </li>
												 </ol>
												</li>
												<li>Procedurally generated two types of enemies and three different power ups to spawn in different locations of the map. Increased difficulty of enemies as game goes on.
												<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; padding-bottom: 0;">
												  <li style="margin-left:2em">Since I was the designer of this game, I had to figure out what type of enemies I wanted to include. I decided to go with a simple obstacle-type (asteroid) and an enemy shooter. Coding their movements was tricky as I had to spawn them randomly and move them similar to the player. </li>
												  <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 0;">I accomplished this by first creating a “spawn field” of some sort. I had min and max x coordinate values and the position of the enemy spawning would be based on a random number from within the range. The enemies would also spawn randomly based on a random number. </li>
												   <li style="margin-left:2em; padding-bottom: 1;">The enemy asteroid was simple enough to code, but the shooter was a bit more complex. I had planned for the shooter to pause around the blackhole and create a ring of defense. This was acoomplished by fixing the enemy shooter radius once it reached a certain limit. I then reversed the asset and invoked a new StartShootingReverse() function, which changed the direction of the projectile. </li>
												 </ol>
												</li>
												<li>Animations were implemented on enemy/player collisions.</li>
												<li>Developed a UI system for the game which includes a menu, player stats and help screen. </li>
